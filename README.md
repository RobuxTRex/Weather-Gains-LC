# Weather Gains
Weather Gains is a highly-configurable BepInEx mod for Lethal Company that increases the value and spawn frequency of scrap based on the current weather.

Weather Gains should be compatible with most versions, however it is only tested for the latest version (currently `v73`). Support for earlier versions is not guaranteed; no active effort will be made to change that.

This mod is available on [Thunderstore / r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/RobuxTRex/Weather_Gains/) and as a [manual download](https://github.com/RobuxTRex/Weather-Gains-LC/releases).

Weather Gains only works when **hosting**. Clients do not need this mod to play, but installing doesn't hurt 😉

## Why Weather Gains?
- Ability to modify the **credit value** and **spawn frequency** of scrap based on the active weather.
- Dynamically supports **all** weather types in Lethal Company; this scales with future versions!
- Guaranteed support with **all mods** (there are no known compatibility issues as of yet).
- Open source under the **APGL v3 or later** license with all contributions welcome!
- Compatibility mode to ensure support with other mods.
- Thoroughly tested with edge cases accounted for.
- No setup neccessary with pre-configured values!
- No dependencies required!

## Quick Start
1. Install the mod through [Thunderstore / r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/RobuxTRex/Weather_Gains/)
2. Launch the game - Weather Gains auto-loads with rational default values.
3. *Optionally* edit `BepInEx/config/uk.co.sulphurdev.weathergains.cfg` to tweak multipliers or enable/disable certain features.

**And that's it!**
